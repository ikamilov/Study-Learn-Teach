# Study-Learn-Teach
Our target audience is designed for students from elementary school, middle school, and high school as well as for adults who forget the basic subject topics.  However, the material we are providing in our website “Children Education” is aimed not only for students but everyone who is interested in learning, reviewing, or using this information. In other words, every individual who can find our web content useful.

The final project is expected to be a simple but resourceful source of information built using the tools stated before. The content of this educational website will include all of the following:

•	Learn basic and important concepts in the fields of Science.
•	Learn basic and important concepts in the fields of Math.
