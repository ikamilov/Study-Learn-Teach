	<h1>The Atom</h1>
	<p>Atoms are the building blocks of matter. They are the basis of all the structures
and organisms in the universe. The planets, the sun, grass and trees, the
air we breathe, and people are all made up of different combinations of atoms.
The idea of atoms was invented by two Greek philosophers, Democritus and
Leucippus in the fifth century BC. The Greek word ατoµoν (atom) means indivisible
beacause they believed that atoms could not be broken down into smaller
pieces. However, the discovery of the fact that an atom is actually a complex
system and can be broken into pieces was the most important step and pivoting
point in the development of modern physics!

<h1>Models of the Atom</h1>
<p>Nowadays, we know that atoms are made up of a positively charged nucleus in
the centre surrounded by orbiting negatively charged electrons. However, in
the past, before the structure of the atom had been discovered, scientists came
up with lots of different models or pictures to describe what atoms look like.</p>
<h1>The Plum Pudding Model</h1>
<p>After the electron was discovered (by J.J. Thomson in 1897), people realised
that atoms were made up of even smaller particles and the plum pudding model
was proposed. In this picture, atoms are thought of as the negative electrons
floating in a soup of positive charge like plums in a pudding or raisins in a fruit
cake!</p>

<h1>The Bohr Model</h1>
<p>Some years later, it was discovered (by Rutherford in 1911) that atoms have a
positively charged nucleus (centre) with the negative electrons moving around
it. This proved that the plum pudding model was wrong and scientists then
pictured the atom like a mini solar system where the electrons orbit the nucleus
like planets orbiting around the sun. There were some problems with this model.
For example it could not explain the very interesting observation that atoms
only emit light at certain wavelengths or frequencies. Niels Bohr solved this
problem by proposing that the electrons could only orbit the nucleus in certain
special orbits with particular energies i.e. energy levels. The exact energies
of the orbitals depends on the type of atom, for example Helium has different
energy levels to Carbon. If an electron jumps down from a higher energy level
(or orbital) to a lower energy level, then light is emitted from the atom. The
energy of the light emitted is the same as the gap in the energy between the
two energy levels.

<h1>Atomic Structure</h1>
<p> So far, we have discussed that atoms are made up of a nucleus surrounded by one or more
electrons.</p>

<h1>The Electron</h1>
<p>The electron is a very light particle. It has mass of 9.11x10^-31kg! Currently,
	scientists believe that the electron can be treated as a point particle or elementary
	particle meaining that is cannot be broken down into anything smaller.

<h1>The Nucleus</h1>
<p>	Unlike the electron, the nucleus can be broken up into smaller building blocks:
protons and neutrons. Collectively the protons and neutrons are called nucleons.</p>
<img src="img/nen.gif" width="100%" height="40%" align="right">
<h1>Isotopes</h1>
<p>The chemical properties of an element are determined by the charge of its atomic
nucleus, i.e. by the number of protons. This number is called the atomic number
and is denoted by the letter Z . The mass of an atom depends on how many
nucleons its nucleus contains. The number of nucleons, i.e. the total number of
protons plus neutrons, is called the atomic mass number and is denoted by
the letter A.
Standard notation shows the chemical symbol, the mass number and the
atomic number as follows:
