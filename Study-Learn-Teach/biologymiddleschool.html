	<h3>What is a living thing?</h2>
	<div class= mainbio>
	<a>

	Something that has life, can move, grow, and die. Also A living thing that eats, gives off wastes, reproduces, and moves around.
	</a>
	</div>
	<img src="img/livingthing.jpg" width="45%" height="30%" align="right">
	<h3>What is non-living thing?</h3>
	<div class= mainbio2>
	<a>
		A non-living thing is one that lacks or has stopped displaying
		the characteristics of life. Thus, they lack or no longer displaying
		the capability for growth, reproduction, respiration, metabolism, and movement.
		They also are not capable of responding to stimuli or evolve and adapt to their environment.

	<h4>7 Characteristic of Living Things</h5>
	<div class= mainbio4>

	  <img src="img/feeding.jpg" width="10%" height="10%" align="left">

	<li><span>Feeding</span></li>
	<p>All living organisms need to take substances from their environment to obtain energy, to grow and to stay healthy.
	 </p>
	<li><span>Movement<span></li>
	  <img src="img/movement.jpg" width="15%" height="15%" align="right">
	<p>All living organisms show movement of one kind or another.
		 All living organisms have internal movement, which means that they have the ability
		  of moving substances from one part of their body to another.
		Some living organisms show external movement as well - they can move from place to place by walking, flying or swimming.
	</p>
		<img src="img/breath.jpg" width="15%" height="10%" align="left">
	<li><span>Breath or Respiration</span></li>

	<p>All living things exchange gases with their environment. Animals take in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide.

	</p>
	<li><span>Excretion</span></li>
	<p>Excretion is the removal of waste from the body. If this waste
		was allowed to remain in the body it could be poisonous.
		 Humans produce a liquid waste called urine. We also
		  excrete waste when we breathe out. All living things need to remove waste from their bodies.
	 	</p>
		<img src="img/growth.jpg" width="25%" height="15%" align="right">
	<li><span>Growth</span></li>
	<p>When living things feed they gain energy. Some of this energy is used in growth. Living things become larger and more complicated as they grow.
	 	</p>


<img src="img/sensiviti.jpg" width="25%" height="20%" align="left">
		<li><span>Sensivity</span></li>
		<p>Living things react to changes around them. We react to touch, light, heat, cold and sound, as do other living things.</p>

		<li><span>Reproduction</span></li>
		<p>All living things produce young. Humans make babies, cats produce kittens and pigeons lay eggs. Plants also reproduce.
			 Many make seeds which can germinate and grow into new plants.</p>

		<h5>Types of Cells in the Body</h5>
		<div class= mainbio4>



		<li><span>Sterm Cells</span></li>
		<img src="img/stemcell.jpg" width="20%" height="18%" align="left">
		<p>Stem cells are unique cells of the body in that they are unspecialized and have the ability to develop into several
			 different types of cells. They are different from specialized cells, such as heart or blood cells, in that
			  they can replicate many times, for long periods of time. This ability is what is known as proliferation.
				 Unlike other cells, stem cells also have the ability to differentiate or develop into specialized cells for specific
				  organs or to develop into tissues. In some tissues, such as muscle or brain tissue, stem cells can even regenerate
					to aid in the replacement of damaged cells. Stem cell research attempts to take advantage of the renewal properties
					 of stem cells by utilizing them to generate cells for tissue repair and the treatment of disease.</p>


	<li><span>Blood Cells</span></li>
	<img src="img/blood.jpg" width="20%" height="18%" align="right">
	<p>Our blood is a fluid that is also a type of connective tissue. It is composed of blood cells and an aqueous
		 fluid known as plasma. Two major functions of the blood include transporting substances to and from our cells
		 and providing immunity and protection against
		 infectious agents such as bacteria and viruses. Blood is a component of the cardiovascular system. It is circulated
		 through the body via the heart and blood vessels
	</p>

	<li><span>Fat Cells</span></li>
	<img src="img/fat.jpg" width="20%" height="18%" align="left">
	<p>Adipose tissue is a lipid storing type of loose connective tissue. Also called fat tissue, adipose is
		 composed primarily of adipose cells or adipocytes. While adipose tissue can be found in a number of places
		 in the body, it is found primarily beneath the skin. Adipose is also located between muscles and around internal
		  organs, particularly those in the abdominal cavity. The energy stored as fat in adipose tissue is used as a fuel
			 source by the body after the available energy acquired from carbohydrates is used up. In addition to storing fat,
			  adipose tissue also produces endocrine hormones which regulate adipocyte activity
		and are necessary for the regulation of other vital bodily processes. Adipose tissue helps to cushion and protect organs,
		 as well as insulate the body from heat loss.
	</p>

	<li><span>Skin Cells</span></li>
	<img src="img/skin.jpg" width="20%" height="18%" align="right">
	<p>
		The integumentary system consists of the largest organ in the body, the skin. This extraordinary organ system protects the
		internal structures of the body
		 from damage, prevents dehydration, stores fat and produces vitamins and hormones
		 . It also helps to maintain homeostasis within the body by assisting in the regulation of body temperature and water balance.
		 The integumentary system is the body's first line of defense against bacteria, viruses and other microbes.
It also helps to provide protection from harmful ultraviolet radiation. The skin is a sensory organ in that it has receptors
 for detecting heat and cold, touch, pressure and pain. Components of the skin include hair, nails, sweat glands, oil glands,
 blood vessels, lymph vessels, nerves and muscles.
	</p>
	<li><span>Endothelial Cells</span></li>
	<img src="img/endothe.jpg"width="20%" height="17%" align="left">
	<p>
		Endothelial cells form the inner lining of cardiovascular
		system and lymphatic system structures. Endothelial cells are
		epithelial cells that form a thin layer of simple squamous epithelium known
		as endothelium. Endothelium makes up the inner layer of vessels such as arteries,
		veins, and lymphatic vessels. In the smallest blood vessels, capillaries and sinusoids,
		endothelium comprises the majority of the vessel.
Blood vessel endothelium is continuous with the inner tissue lining of organs
such as the brain, lungs, skin, and heart.
	</p>

	<li><span>Nerve Cells</span></li>
	<img src="img/nerve.jpg"width="20%" height="16%" align="right">
	<p>
		Neurons are the basic unit of the nervous system and
		 nervous tissue. All cells of the nervous system are comprised of
		 neurons. The nervous system can be divided into two parts: the central
		  nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. The central nervous
		system consists of the brain and spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous
		 system consists of sensory and motor nervous cells that run throughout the rest of the body.
	</p>
	<li><span>Cancer Cells</span></li>
	<img src="img/cancer.jpg" width="20%" height="18%" align="left">
	<p>
		Cancer cells are abnormal cells that reproduce rapidly,
		 maintaining their ability to replicate and grow. This unchecked cell
		 growth results in the development of masses of tissue or tumors. The tumors
		 continue to grow and some, known as malignant tumors, can spread from one
		 location to another. Cancer cells
		 differ from normal cells in a number or ways. Cancer cells don't experience
		  biological aging, maintain their ability to divide, and do not respond to
			self termination signals.
