<h3>Brain and Senses</h3>
<div class= mainbio4>
<a>

Your brain is the most complex part of your body, it performs a
large number of amazing calculations every second, taking in
information from the outside world in the form of senses and
allowing you to quickly respond to various situations.<p></p>
<h3>We have 5 main senses</h3>
<img src="img/senses.jpg" width="100%" height="40%" align="right">
<li><span>Smell</span></li>
<img src="img/nose.jpg" width="45%" height="20%" align="right">
<p>
Your nose does a lot more than keep your glasses in place!
 It allows you to smell and to taste the food you eat.
  The nose is the beginning of your respiratory system –
  the system that allows you breathe.
 It also contains tiny hairs that help to keep you healthy
  by trapping dust and microbes.
There are at least 10 million receptors in your nose!!
  Between them, these receptors can recognise about 10,000
  different types of smells – some of them good and some of
  them very bad!</p>
<li><span>Hear</span></li>
<img src="img/ear.jpg" width="30%" height="15%" align="right">
<p>The sounds you hear every day are collected by your ears.
   Your ears transport these sounds to your brain so it can
    figure out what each sound is.  Hearing helps you to learn
    and to communicate with everyone around you.
   Your ears also have another really important job –
   they stop you from falling over!
</p>
<li><span>Taste</span></li>
<img src="img/tass.gif" width="30%" height="15%" align="right">
<p>
  Your mouth is made up of the teeth and
  tongue and it does a lot more than just help you chew;
   it helps you to speak or sing, allows you to smile or
    frown and produces saliva that helps to prevent infection.
     The best part of your mouth
   though is your tongue because it allows you to taste the good
   things that you like to eat!
</p>
<li><span>Touch</span></li>
<img src="img/tooch.gif" width="30%" height="15%" align="right">
<p>
  Your skin is an amazing organ and is very important in
   keeping you healthy.  It is very tough and holds all your
   inside bits, inside!  Your skin makes sweat that helps to protect
   you and oils to keep you healthy.  Sweat also helps to regulate your
    body temperature.  You touch lots and lots of different
  things every day and your skin can figure out what most of them are!
</p>
<li><span>See<span></li>
	<img src="img/seee.gif" width="45%" height="30%" align="right">
<p>
  Your eyes are some of the hardest working parts of your body!
    They work from the very beginning of your day, right to the very
     end when you go to sleep.  Your eyes are like cameras - they take
     images from the world around you and send the information to your brain.
     Your brain then figures out what you are looking at.
  There are lots of different parts to your eyes.
</p>
 Each one of them is really important in your everyday life.
 You use at least one of your five senses every moment of every
 day and they are on duty even when you are asleep!  Your senses
work together to let your brain know what is going on around you.
They help to keep you safe by warning you of any danger.
