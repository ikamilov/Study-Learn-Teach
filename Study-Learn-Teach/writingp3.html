	<h1>Basic Writing: Middle School</h1>
	<h2>Puntuation Signs</h2>
	
	
	
	<p>Punctuation is the system of signs or symbols given to a reader to show how a sentence is constructed and how it should be read.</p>
	<p>Sentences are the building blocks used to construct written accounts.  They are complete statements.  Punctuation shows how the sentence should be read and makes the meaning clear.</p>
	<p>Every sentence should include at least a capital letter at the start, and a full stop, exclamation mark or question mark at the end. This basic system indicates that the sentence is complete.</p>
	<p>The Basic Signs of Punctuation are:</p>
	
	<img id="wp2" src="writingpics/img2.png" align="">
		<ul>
			<li>The comma ","</li>
			<li>The full stop "."</li>
			<li>The exclamation mark "!"</li>
			<li>The question mark "?"</li>
			<li>The semi-colon ";"</li>
			<li>The colon ":"</li>
			<li>The Apostrophe "'"</li>
			<li>The hyphen"-"</li>
	
	<h2>The Basic Signs of Puntuations</h2>
	
	<h3>The Comma(,)</h3>
	
	<p>The comma is useful in a sentence when the writer wishes to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>pause before proceeding</li>
		<li>add a phrase that does not contain any new subject</li>
		<li>separate items on a list</li>
		<li>use more than one adjective (a describing word, like beautiful)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>For example, in the following sentence the phrase or clause between the commas gives us more information behind the actions of the boy, the subject of the sentence:</p>
	<p>The boy, who knew that his mother was about to arrive, ran quickly towards the opening door.</p>
	
	<h3>Full Stop(.)</h3>
	
	<p>A full stop should always be used to end a sentence.  The full stop indicates that a point has been made and that you are about to move on to further explanations or a related point.</p>
	<p>Less frequently, a series of three full stops (an ellipsis) can be used to indicate where a section of a quotation has been omitted when it is not relevant to the text, for example:</p>
	<p>“The boy was happy… at the start of his summer holiday.”</p>
	
	<h3>Exclamation Mark(!)</h3>
	
	<p>An exclamation mark indicates strong feeling within a sentence, such as fear, anger or love. It is also used to accentuate feeling within the written spoken word. </p>
	<p>For Example:</p>
	<p>"Help! I love you!"</p>
	<p>In this way, it can also be used to indicate a sharp instruction</p>
		<ul>
			<li>"Stop! Police!"</li>
		</ul>
	<p>or to indicate humour</p>
		<ul>
			<li>"Ha! Ha! Ha!"</li>
		</ul>
	<p>The exclamation mark at the end of a sentence means that you do not need a full stop.</p>
	<p>Exclamation marks are a poor way of emphasising what you think are important points in your written assignments; the importance of the point will emphasise itself without a sequence of !!! in the text. An exclamation mark should only be used when absolutely essential, or when taken from a direct quote.</p>
	<p>The exclamation mark should be used sparingly in formal and semi-formal writing.</p>
	
	<h3>Question Mark(?)</h3>
	
	<p>The question mark simply indicates that a sentence is asking a question.  It always comes at the end of a sentence: </p>
	<p>For example: </p>
	<p>Are we at the end?</p>
	
	<h3>Semi-colon(;)</h3>
	
	<p>The semi-colon is perhaps the most difficult sign of punctuation to use accurately.  If in doubt, avoid using it and convert the added material into a new sentence.</p>
	<p>As a general rule, the semi-colon is used in the following ways:</p>
	<p>When joining two connected sentences.</p>
	<p>For example:</p>
	<p>We set out at dawn; the weather looked promising.</p>
	<p>or</p>
	<p>Assertive behaviour concerns being able to express feelings, wants and desires appropriately; passive behaviour means complying with the wishes of others</p>
	
	<h3>Colon(;)</h3>
	
	<p>The colon within a sentence makes a very pointed pause between two phrases.  There are two main uses of the colon:</p>
	<p>It is most commonly used when listing. </p>
	<p>For example:</p>
	<p>She placed the following items into the trolley: beer, fruit, vegetables, toilet rolls, cereals and cartons of milk.</p>
	
	<h3>Quotation Marks("...")</h3>
	
	<p>Quotation or speech marks are used to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To mark out speech</li>
			<li>When quoting someone else's speech</li>
		</ul>
	<p>For example:</p>
	<p>My grandpa said, "Share your chocolates with your friends."	</p>
	<p>"George, don't do that!"</p>
	<p>"Will you get your books out please?” said Mrs Jones, the teacher, “and quieten down!"</p>
	
	<h3>Hyphen(-)</h3>
	
	<p>The hyphen is used to link words together.</p>
	<p>For Example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Sub-part</li>
		<li>Eighteenth-century people</li>
		<li>Week-end</li>
		<li>Second-class post</li>
		<li>Gender-neutral</li>
		<li>Non-verbal</li>
	</ul>
