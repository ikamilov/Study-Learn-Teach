		<h1>Introduction to Art</h1>
		
		<h2>What is art?</h2>
		
	
			<img id="mona" src="img/picture1.jpg" width = "400" height ="600" align="right">
		
		<p>Art can be much more than a rectangular painting on a wall, or a piece of sculpture on a pedestal. Since the early 20th century, art has continued to evolve more forms, many of which cross over old or arbitrary barriers of labels and categories. Like today's music, contemporary art wants to mix forms together, and create entirely new ones. If we ask why, can't we also ask, why not? The main objective, and distinguishing characteristic, of good art, is its expression - what it is "saying." To accomplish this communication, artists need to create freely and question assumptions about art, and about themselves and their audience.
		Art is ambiguous and subjective. If we ask different persons “what is art” they are going to tell different definitions. For some it can be a picture of a horse, a landscape, the universe or anything else. This means that there is not a correct meaning for art. A great deal of works that are consider like art such as Mona Lisa (see figure 1) have become well known through centuries, and a great deal of people would agree that those works can be considered as art.
		</p>

		<h2>Why is art important</h2>
		
		<p>Artists can strengthen the will and push people to act. Artists do not think like policy makers or academics people. Artists think from their heart – big, revolutionary and visionary ideas. This is why artists are able to move people to action, thus creates a significant cultural and political contributions.
		</p>
		
		<h2>This is what makes art powerful</h2>
			<p>Art is very important in society because it is an essential ingredient to empowering the hearts of people
		When activists are showing images of children suffering from poverty or oppression in their campaigns, this is the art pulling the heartstrings of society’s elite and powerful to make changes.
		When photographers publish the photos of war torn areas, it catches the attention of masses whose hearts reach out for those who need help. When artist create great music and movies, it entertains people around the world. This is art, making a difference in society.

		<h2>What are the functions of art</h2>
			<p>While many can argue or have different point of views, these points reflect and evolve in our understanding of ourselves, each other, and the world we live in:</p>
			<img id="pic3" width = "350" height = "350" src="img/picture3.jpg" align="right">
		<ol>
			<li>Memory – Artists not only preserve a visual reminder of a memory, they record the emotions associated with the memory.</li>
			<li>Hope – Art reminds us that there is beauty in the world that we can strive to see it, appreciate it, and have it</li>
			<li>Sorrow – Art doesn’t just increase our capacity for joy, it validates our sorrows</li>
			<li>Re-balancing – We gain balance through art by taking a moment to observe, judge, and appreciate things we don’t normally see and our responses to them</li>
			<li>Growth – Art forces you to react and empathize with situations that you’re not accustomed to. This is growth</li>
			<li>Appreciation – Art helps us to revisit the value of ordinary things like the pretty colors in a splash of morning light on a table cloth or the familiar and nostalgic aspects of old beer cans.</li>
			<li>Self-Understanding – Art helps us to complete our own unformed thoughts and ideas</li>
		</ol>
