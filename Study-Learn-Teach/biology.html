<h2>The birth of biology: 5th - 4th century BC</h2>

The Greek philosophers,
voracious in their curiosity,
look with interest at the range
of living creatures, from the humblest
plant to man himself. A Greek name is
coined by a German naturalist in the
early 19th century for this study of
all physical aspects of natural life -
biology, from bios (life) and logos (word or discourse).
It is a subject with clear subdivisions,
such as botany, zoology or anatomy. But all are
concerned with living organisms.
The first man to make a significant
contribution in biology is Alcmaeon,
living in Crotona in the 5th century.
Crotona is famous at the time for its Pythagorean
scholars, but Alcmaeon seems not to have been of their school.
Alcmaeon is the first scientist known to have practised dissection in
his researches. His aim is not anatomical, for his interest lies in
trying to find the whereabouts of human intelligence. But in the course of
his researches he makes the first scientific discoveries in the field of anatomy.
The subsequent Greek theory, subscribed to even by Aristotle, is that
the heart is the seat of intelligence. Alcmaeon reasons that since a blow
to the head can affect the mind, in concussion, this must be where reason
lies. In dissecting corpses to pursue this idea, he observes passages
linking the brain with the eyes (the optic nerves) and the back of the
mouth with the ears (Eustachian tubes).Aristotle may be wrong about the brain being
in the heart, but in general he gives a far more complete and well observed account
of biology than any other Greek philosopher.He inaugurates scientific zoology in his
reliance on careful observation. He is particularly acute in his study of marine life,
having much to say on the habits of fishes, the development of the octopus family,
and the nature of whales, dolphins and porpoises. He is also a pioneer in attempting a
system of classification. Observing an unbroken chain of gradual developments, as the life
of plants shades into that of animals, he acknowledges the complexity of the subject and
seems almost to glimpse the pattern of evolution.<img src="img/bio.jpg" width="100%" height="40%" align="right"> Aristotle's notes on botany are lost,
but many of his observations no doubt survive in the earliest known botanical text - nine
books On the History of Plants written by Aristotle's favourite pupil, Theophrastus.
Writing in about 300 BC, Theophrastus attempts to classify plants, as well as describing
their structure, habits and uses. His remarks are based on observations carried out in Greece,
but he also includes information brought back from the new Hellenistic empire in the Middle East,
Persia and India, resulting from the conquests of Alexander the Great.
The influential errors of Galen: 2nd century AD The newly appointed chief physician
to the gladiators in Pergamum, in AD 158, is a native of the city. He is a Greek doctor
by the name of Galen. The appointment gives him the opportunity to study wounds of all
kinds. His knowledge of muscles enables him to warn his patients of the likely outcome
of certain operations - a wise precaution recommended in Galen's Advice to doctors.
But it is Galen's dissection of apes and pigs which give him the detailed information
for his medical tracts on the organs of the body. Nearly 100 of these tracts survive.
They become the basis of Galen's great reputation in medieval medicine, unchallenged until
the anatomical work of Vesalius. Through his experiments Galen is able to overturn many
long-held beliefs, such as the theory (first proposed by the Hippocratic school in about
400 BC, and maintained even by the physicians of Alexandria) that the arteries contain air -
carrying it to all parts of the body from the heart and the lungs. This belief is based
originally on the arteries of dead animals, which appear to be empty. Galen is able to demonstrate
 that living arteries contain blood. His error, which will become the established medical orthodoxy
 for centuries, is to assume that the blood goes back and forth from the heart in an ebb-and-flow
 motion. This theory holds sway in medical circles until the time of Harvey.
 Science's siesta: 8th - 15th century
 In the profoundly Christian centuries of the European Middle Ages the prevailing mood is
 not conducive to scientific enquiry. God knows best, and so He should - since He created everything.
 Where practical knowledge is required, there are ancient authorities whose conclusions are accepted
 without question - Ptolemy in the field of astronomy, Galen on matters anatomical.
A few untypical scholars show an interest in scientific research. The 13th-century Franciscan
friar Roger Bacon is the most often quoted example, but his studies include alchemy and a
strology as well as optics and astronomy. The practical scepticism required for science must await the Renaissance.
